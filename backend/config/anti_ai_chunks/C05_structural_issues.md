### Structural issues
- **Uniform paragraph length**: Vary deliberately. Include some 1-2 sentence paragraphs and some longer ones. If every paragraph is roughly the same size, fix it.
- **Formulaic openings**: If the piece opens with broad context before getting to the point ("In the rapidly evolving world of..."), rewrite to lead with the news or the insight. Context can come second.
- **Suspiciously clean grammar**: Don't sand away all personality. Deliberate fragments, sentences starting with "And" or "But," comma splices for effect: if the natural voice uses them, keep them.

### Speculative scenario openers
- "Imagine a world where…", "Picture a future in which…", "Envision a world where…" AI opens an argument with a hypothetical that lists desirable outcomes instead of making a claim. The scenario does the persuading; no evidence is offered.
- Fix: cut the hypothetical and state the real claim. "Imagine a world where every deploy is instant" becomes "Instant deploys would cut our release cycle from a day to minutes."
- Carve-out: fiction, a thought experiment with a stated payoff, and instructional "imagine you have a sorted array" (a teaching device pointing at a concrete example, not a speculative world) are fine. Flag only the world/future-scenario opener that stands in for an argument. Source: tropes.fyi (Imagine a World Where).

### Numbered list inflation
- "Three key takeaways" / "Five things to know" / "Here are the top seven" — AI defaults to numbered lists because they're structurally safe. Only use numbered lists when the content genuinely has that many discrete, parallel items. If you're padding to hit a number, the list shouldn't exist.

### Reasoning chain artifacts
- "Let me think step by step," "Breaking this down," "To approach this systematically," "Step 1:," "Here's my thought process," "First, let's consider," "Working through this logically" — these are artifacts of chain-of-thought reasoning leaking into published prose. The reader doesn't need to see the scaffolding. State the conclusion, then the evidence.
- Also watch for numbered reasoning steps that read like an internal monologue rather than an argument meant for an audience.

### Wall-of-text replies (missing line breaks)
- In conversational registers — issue and PR comments, chat, DMs, casual email — humans break a reply at thought boundaries: one idea, then a break, then the next. LLMs default to a single dense block regardless of length. The tell: a reply-length text (roughly under 150 words) with four or more sentences delivered as one unbroken paragraph, no line break anywhere in it.
- Fix: break at thought boundaries. One idea per line-group, the way a person actually types a reply.
- Observed in the wild: a maintainer on a GitHub issue called out an assisted-sounding reply with "I prefer to talk human to human" — the dense block-paragraph shape was the tell, not any single word in it.
- Distinct from paragraph-length uniformity (which is about long-form prose where every paragraph is the same size): this rule is about short, reply-length text having *zero* breaks at all, not uneven ones.
- Carve-out: a single dense paragraph is the *correct* shape in formal, long-form registers — a blog intro, a docs paragraph, a deliberately tight one-paragraph email. This rule fires only in conversational reply registers; never flag continuous long-form prose just because it lacks internal breaks. That false-positive class is exactly why the structural detector was reverted (see `detector/CATEGORIES.md` §C), and why the tolerance matrix below is the wrong home for it: a plain issue comment auto-detects to the `blog` profile, so the scoping has to live in this rule's judgment, not in a per-profile strictness cell.

### Excessive structure
- Too many headers in short text: more than 3 headings in under 300 words is almost always AI trying to look organized. Merge sections or use prose transitions instead.
- Too many list items: 8+ bullet points in under 200 words means the content should be a paragraph, not a list.
- Formulaic section headers: "Overview," "Key Points," "Summary," "Conclusion," "Introduction" — these are default AI scaffolding. Use headers that tell the reader something specific about what follows.
- Fragmented headers: a heading followed by a one-line warm-up that restates it ("## Performance", then "Speed matters.") before the real content starts. Cut the warm-up; the heading already did that job. Adapted from `blader/humanizer` P29.

### Diff-anchored writing
- Documentation or comments narrating a change instead of describing the thing as it is: "This function was added to replace the previous approach of iterating through all items." A reader without the commit history gets archaeology, not documentation. The tell comes from how assistants work — they write docs in the context of the edit they just made, so the prose anchors to the diff; a person documenting later writes from the artifact.
- Fix: describe the current behavior and why it is that way — "This function uses a hash map for O(1) lookups." If the history matters, it belongs in the changelog or the commit message.
- Carve-out: documents that are inherently version-scoped — changelogs, release notes, migration guides, decision records — narrate change correctly and stay unflagged. Adapted from `blader/humanizer` P30.

### Paragraph-reshuffle immunity (structure test)
- A writer-side diagnostic, not a regex: can you swap two body paragraphs without breaking the piece? If the order doesn't matter, you've written a list of points, not an argument that builds. AI prose often fails this — each paragraph is a self-contained module with no load-bearing connection to its neighbors.
- The fix is structural, not lexical: establish a through-line where each paragraph depends on the one before it. If the paragraphs are genuinely independent, decide whether the piece should be an explicit list, or whether it's missing a thesis. Adapted from `Aboudjem/humanizer-skill` P38.

### Treadmill effect / low information density (content test)
- Another writer-side test: read each paragraph and ask "what's actually new here?" AI prose frequently restates the premise in fresh words instead of advancing it — lots of motion, no distance covered. The tell is that you could cut 40-60% and lose no information.
- The fix: for each paragraph, name the one fact, claim, or turn it contributes. If there isn't one, cut it. If there is, lead with it and drop the throat-clearing. Adapted from `Aboudjem/humanizer-skill` P43.

### P2 — Stylistic polish (fix when time allows)
- Generic conclusions ("The future looks bright")
- Compulsive rule of three
- Uniform paragraph length
- Copula avoidance (serves as, features, boasts)
- Transition phrases (Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally)
- Hashtag stuffing (`blog`/`technical-blog` profiles)
- Tier 3 phrase repetition (single phrase ≥2× — fine in isolation, suspect in stacks)
- Unnecessary hyphenation (curated open, closed, and position-dependent compounds)
